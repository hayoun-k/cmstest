# 🍫 Delicious Chocolate Cake

## 📝 Ingredients
- 1 ¾ cups (220g) all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups (300g) sugar
- ¾ cup (75g) unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 ½ tsp baking powder
- 1 ½ tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup (240ml) milk
- ½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup (240ml) boiling water

## 🏗 Instructions

1. **Preheat** your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round baking pan.
2. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. **Add wet ingredients**: Stir in eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla. Mix until smooth.
4. **Pour in boiling water**: Slowly mix in the boiling water. The batter will be thin—this is normal!
5. **Bake** for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
6. **Cool** in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.
7. **Enjoy!** Serve with whipped cream or a dusting of powdered sugar.

## 🍴 Serving Suggestions
- Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.
- Add a drizzle of chocolate ganache for extra richness.

## 📌 Notes
- You can substitute milk with almond or oat milk for a dairy-free version.
- For extra moisture, add ¼ cup of sour cream.

### **2. Explanation of This Structure**
- **Frontmatter (`---`)**: This contains metadata like the **title**, **date**, **categories**, **tags**, **image**, and **prep/cook time**. Decap CMS uses this for content management.
- **Headers (`#`, `##`)**: Used to organize the recipe clearly.
- **Lists (`-`, `1.`)**: Bullet points for ingredients and numbered steps for instructions.
- **Bold (`**bold**`) and Emojis (`🍫`)**: Enhances readability and adds personality to the recipe.
- **Horizontal Line (`---`)**: Separates sections for clarity.

This format works well with **Decap CMS** because the **frontmatter** fields make it easy to filter and sort recipes. Astro will render it as structured HTML when displaying the blog post.

Would you like a custom **Astro component** to display this recipe nicely? 🚀
